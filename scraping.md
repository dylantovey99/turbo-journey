# Web Scraping Enhancement Roadmap

## üéØ Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to transform our web scraping system from a basic implementation to a robust, production-ready solution that can handle modern anti-bot detection and deliver high-quality data.

## ‚úÖ Module 1: Critical Code Fixes (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Implemented ‚úÖ  
**Issues Fixed:**
- Added missing `extractHeadings()` and `extractMainContent()` methods
- Standardized ScrapedData structure across Puppeteer and HTTP modes
- Implemented proper error categorization with ScrapingError class
- Enhanced browser resource management with graceful shutdown
- Fixed memory leaks and improved cleanup processes

**Outcome:** HTTP fallback no longer crashes, consistent data structure, better error reporting

### Stealth Plugin Integration
```bash
npm install puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Replace Standard Puppeteer**
   - Integrate puppeteer-extra with stealth plugin
   - Remove HeadlessChrome identifiers
   - Hide navigator.webdriver property

2. **Browser Fingerprint Randomization**
   - Rotate user agents from real browser pool
   - Randomize viewport sizes and screen resolutions
   - Vary language and timezone settings

3. **Human Behavior Simulation**
   - Random mouse movements and clicks
   - Natural scrolling patterns with delays
   - Variable typing speeds for form inputs
   - Realistic page interaction sequences

4. **Session Management**
   - Cookie persistence across requests
